Pancake
=======

This is a CLI/Emacs web/gopher/file browser.

It utilizes pandoc and external downloaders such as curl, adding
support for Gopher directories and plain text files, and invoking
external applications (e.g., image and PDF viewers) depending on its
configuration.

User interaction capabilities are rather basic, as it is intended to
be combined with software that provides better user interfaces â€“ such
as emacs, rlwrap, tmux, screen.


Installation
------------

Retrieval
~~~~~~~~~

There is a few ways to get a recent version of pancake:

- source and binary distributions:
  https://defanor.uberspace.net/projects/pancake/
- git repository: https://git.uberspace.net/pancake/
- github: https://github.com/defanor/pancake/


Pancake
~~~~~~~

``cabal install`` would build and install pancake and its
documentation. Alternatively, basic Debian packages and binary
releases are available.


Emacs interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/pancake.el RET``. To set it as
your default emacs browser::

  (require 'pancake)
  (setq browse-url-browser-function 'pancake-browse-url)

To load and show all images automatically (not just after saving them
manually)::

  (add-hook 'pancake-display-hook 'pancake-load-images)

Though it might be desirable to write a wrapper to only show those on
specific websites, e.g. webcomics, and perhaps specific images only.

Commands
--------

:quit or EOF: quit pancake, cleaning the cache
:[: back
:]: forward
:reload config: reload config
:help: show a help message
:?: show current URI
:RET (empty): show the next 2/3 of a page, if pagination is enabled
:<URI>: follow an URI, possibly relative to the current one
:<type> <URI>: same as above, but explicitly set a document type
               (html, txt, org, markdown, etc)
:[,]<number>: follow a link
:,: reload current document
:save <URI>[ <path>]: retrieve data and save it
:save [,]<number>[ <path>]: save linked data
:save ,[ <path>]: save current document
:<shortcut> <query>: run a query using a shortcut defined in the
                     configuration (e.g., search)

pancake-mode provides additional aliases and commands, see built-in
emacs documentation (``C-h m``) for those.


Configuration
-------------

Default configuration will be written into XDG configuration
directory, and would look approximately like this (slightly
simplified)::

  externalViewers:
    png: xdg-open "${FILE}"
    hs: emacsclient -n "${FILE}"
  indentDivs: false
  commands:
    gopher: torify curl "${URI}"
    ssh: scp "${URI_REGNAME}:${URI_PATH}" /dev/stdout
  defaultCommand: ! 'curl --compressed -4 -L -w "

    -pancake-

    uri: %{url_effective}

    type: %{content_type}

    " "${URI}"'
