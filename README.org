This is a CLI/emacs web/gopher/file browser inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Mode_Browser][Line Mode
Browser]].

It utilizes [[http://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] and external downloaders such as [[https://curl.haxx.se/][curl]], adding
support for Gopher directories and plaintext files, and invoking
external applications (e.g., image and PDF viewers) depending on its
configuration.

User interaction capabilities are rather basic, as it is intended to
be combined with software that provides better user interfaces -- such
as emacs, rlwrap, tmux, screen.

* Installation
** Pancake
~cabal install~ would build and install pancake and its documentation.
Alternatively, basic Debian packages and binary releases are
available.

** Emacs interface
~M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/pancake.el RET~. To set it as
your default emacs browser:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'pancake)
(setq browse-url-browser-function 'pancake-browse-url)
#+END_SRC

* Commands

- [q]uit, [b]ack, [f]orward, [h]elp, [r]eload, [re]load config
- <number>: follow a link (or open the referenced file)
- ?<number>: show link/image URI
- ?: show current URI
- RET (empty): show the next 2/3 of a page, if pagination is enabled
- <URI>: follow an URI, possibly relative to the current one
- <type> <URI>: same as above, but explicitly set a document type
  (html, txt, org, markdown, etc)
- <shortcut> <query>: run a query using a shortcut defined in the
  configuration (e.g., search)

pancake-mode provides additional aliases, see built-in emacs
documentation (~C-h m~) for those.

* Configuration

Default configuration will be written into XDG configuration
directory, and would look approximately like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
externalViewers:
  png: xdg-open "${FILE}"
  hs: emacsclient -n "${FILE}"
commands:
  gopher: torify curl "${URI}"
  ssh: scp "${URI_REGNAME}:${URI_PATH}" /dev/stdout
defaultCommand: ! 'curl -4 -L "${URI}" -w "

  -pancake-

  type: %{content_type}
